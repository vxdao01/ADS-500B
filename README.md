Final Project 
In this folder we have total 5 files which are part1.ipynb, part2.ipynb, and part3.ipynb are coresonding to par1, part 2 and part 3 of the final project.
There are 2 dataset files are the original house_sales.cvs file, and the other dataset file is transformed_house_sales2 which is the output from part1 (after handling the missing values). Part 2, and Part 3 will take "transformed_house_sales2" as their input file. 
Brief summary: 
Part 1 code: mostly importint data, handling missing value of the dataset, clean data, transform data appropriately using techniques such as aggregation, normalization, and feature construction, reduce redundant data and perform need-based discretization
Part 2 code: 2.	data Analysis and Visualization, identify categorical, ordinal, and numerical variables within the data, provide measures of centrality and distribution with visualizations, diagnose for correlations between variables and determine independent and dependent variables, perform exploratory analysis in combination with visualization techniques to discover patterns and features of interest
Part 3 code: determine the need for a supervised or unsupervised learning method and identify dependent and independent variables, train, test, and provide accuracy and evaluation metrics for model results
